# scammy-bbp
Self-hosted bug bounty programs that are "scammy" or unethical can sometimes involve promising rewards to researchers for identifying security flaws, but either delay payments, don't pay at all, or misuse the disclosed vulnerabilities. 


Signs of a Potentially Scammy Bug Bounty Program:

- Unclear Terms and Conditions: Programs that don't clearly specify what vulnerabilities qualify for rewards or the amount of the reward.
- No Transparent Payment Structure: Lack of details about payment timelines, payout methods, or cases where people report not getting paid.
- Absence of a Proper Vulnerability Disclosure Policy: No clear process for how to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.
- Little to No Community Feedback: Lack of reputation or negative reviews from the infosec community.

- Ignored reports: They never replied back to researcher. 
- No rewards: They promise rewards for reports in their program, but fail to pay them. Sometimes they just say they stopped paying rewards or they can't do it anymore.
